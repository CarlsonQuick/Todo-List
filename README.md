# Todo-List
Things I'd like to play with that I haven't gotten a chance to yet.  

- Watercooler chat replacement, pull active directory data and set up random group chats or invites for people to chat day to day
- Do a html5 game, never have, always wanted to
- More cool things with pandas/numpy just to feel like I understand it better
- Do something successfull and interesting with functional programming.   
- Learn Teraform
